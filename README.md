This is a template esque project for the 1010Z VEX robotics team including constant distance sensor reset code, a RAMSETE controller for motions, which uses squiggles to generated splines, and it uses LemLib, made by Liam Teale, as a base for all of this code and basic functionality for drivetrain commands and controller inputs, etc.
